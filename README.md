# Sorry
This is a script I wrote to migrate from Pinterest to Raindrop.io after Pinterest refused to save a link for the one billionth time due to a bug in Pinterest.

I don't intend to maintain this, but it might be useful for someone else so enjoy.

## Use

### Install

I recommend using a python virtualenv to save yourself some mess later
```
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
```
python main.py PINTEREST_EMAIL PINTEREST_PASSWORD PINTEREST_USERNAME RAINDROP_IO_API_KEY
```
